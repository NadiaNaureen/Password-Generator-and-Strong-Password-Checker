# Password-Generator-and-Strong-Password-Checker

Password Generator and Strong Password Checker help to generate a strong password and check if the given password by the user is strong or not. 

To generate a strong password, the code gives a combination of passwords and stores them in a 2D array. The user gives the input of the number of characters. Using random, one of the combinations is chosen and a strong password is generated.

To check if a password given by the user is strong or not few desired conditions should be met. If those conditions are met then the password given by the user is strong.

The code also checks the time taken to crack a password by a hacker.

With all these excellent features this project helps to get along with an efficient Password Generator.
