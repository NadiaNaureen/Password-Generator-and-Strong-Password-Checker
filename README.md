# Password-Generator-and-Strong-Password-Checker

Password Generator and Strong Password Checker help to generate a strong password. If the user wants to check if the password is strong or not, this code will help the user understand the strength of their password.

To generate a strong password, the code gives a combination of passwords and stores them in a 2D array. Using random, one of the combinations is chosen and it generates a strong password.
